## Installation

### Requirements <a name="requisites"></a>

- Ubuntu 20.04

### Installing ROS Noetic <a name="noetic"></a>

A detailed ROS Noetic installation guide can be found in the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

#### Setup your sources

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

#### Set up your keys

```bash
sudo apt install curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

#### Installing ROS Noetic

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

#### Environment setup

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Dependencies for building packages

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```
### Creating a virtualenv

It is recommended to use virtual environment for Behavior Metrics. Use **Python version->3.8** or **below.**

```bash
# Create virtualenv
virtualenv -p python=3.8 .behavior-metrics
source .behavior-metrics/bin/activate
pip3 install empy
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```

### Install Catkin_pkg
```bash
pip3 install catkin_pkg
```
### Installing dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

#### JdeRobot's CustomRobots
The CustomRobots repository is only needed for launching Behavior Metrics with Gazebo. Since our main simulator is CARLA we don't need it for running behavior-metrics with CARLA based simulation. 
- Clone this repository in your home directory.
```bash
git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/JdeRobot/CustomRobots
cd CustomRobots/CustomRobots/f1 && mkdir build && cd build
/bin/bash -c "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash;
cmake .. && make && sudo make install;"
echo "source /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/assets-setup.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### ROS additional package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus
cd Sophus && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ && make && sudo make install
```

### Installing Behavior Metrics <a name="behavior-metrics"></a>

This application depends on some third party libraries, most of them are included in the requirements file. To install them just type the following:

- Clone this repository in your home directory.

```bash
git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics
cd BehaviorMetrics
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are going to use the GUI you need to create the resources file for the application. 

```bash
pyrcc5 -o behavior_metrics/ui/gui/resources/resources.py \
	behavior_metrics/ui/gui/resources/resources.qrc
```

### Installing CARLA simulator and support <a name="carla-simulator"></a>

For installing CARLA and supporting this new simulator:

1. Install [CARLA 0.9.15](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/start_quickstart/) . Currently, the official Carla server is down. Therefore, it is advisable to install Carla using the GitHub package method instead of the Debian package method.

For manual Installation of CARLA follow the below instructions:-

i) Install Required System Dependency

Before downloading CARLA, install the necessary system dependency:

```
sudo apt-get -y install libomp5
```
ii) Download the CARLA 0.9.15 Release

Download the CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz file (approximately 16GB) from the official release:

```
wget https://carla-releases.s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/Linux/CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz
```
iii) Unpack CARLA to the Desired Directory

Unpack the downloaded file to /opt/carla-simulator/:
```
tar -xzvf CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz -C /opt/carla-simulator/
```
iv) Install the CARLA Python Module

Finally, install the CARLA Python module and necessary dependencies:
```
python -m pip install carla==0.9.15
python -m pip install -r /opt/carla-simulator/PythonAPI/examples/requirements.txt
``` 

2. Install [CARLA ROS Bridge](https://carla.readthedocs.io/projects/ros-bridge/en/latest/ros_installation_ros1/)
3. Install this [fork](https://github.com/Qi-Zha0/carla-birdeye-view) of the [CARLA bird-eye-view](https://github.com/deepsense-ai/carla-birdeye-view)
```
    cd /PATH/TO/BEHAVIOR/METRICS/BehaviorMetrics/behavior_metrics
    git clone https://github.com/Qi-Zha0/carla-birdeye-view
```
4. Add variables to PYTHONPATH following the simulator installation instructions and ROS bridge installation instructions.
```
    source ~/carla-ros-bridge/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    export CARLA_ROOT=<PATH-TO-CARLA>/carla/
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.15-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg   
    export OBJECT_PATH=<PATH-TO-BEHAVIOR-METRICS>/behavior_metrics/configs/CARLA/CARLA_launch_files/CARLA_object_files/parked_car_objects.json
```
Note: `$OBJECT_PATH` is a sample CARLA objects json file containing objects to be spawned in the CARLA simulator. You can use your own json file by setting $OBJECT_PATH. More details about this are added in [Quick Start guide](../carla/)

5. Test that everything is correctly set up running the example configuration file:
```bash
  python3 driver_carla.py -c configs/CARLA/default_carla.yml -g
```

## (Optional) Installing for Drone <a name="drone-simulation"></a>

For installing and launching drone:

1. Install [JDE-drone](https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones/tree/noetic-devel). do source install, inside your ROS workspace.
```
git clone https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones.git -b noetic-devel
cd ~/catkin_ws/src && ln -s drones/drone_wrapper .
cd ~/catkin_ws/src && ln -s drones/drone_assets .
cd ~/catkin_ws/src && ln -s drones/rqt_drone_teleop .
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
cd /drones/drone_circuit_assets && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
sudo make install
```
Add environment variables
```
echo 'export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}:/usr/share/gazebo-11' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}:~/catkin_ws/drones/drone_assets/models' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

2. Install [PX4](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html)

To install PX4 toolchain :

a. Download PX4 source Code

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git 
```
b. Run the ubuntu.sh with no arguments (in a bash shell) to install everything:
```
bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
```
Acknowledge any prompts as the script progress.

You can use the --no-nuttx and --no-sim-tools options to omit the NuttX and/or simulation tools.

Then restart your computer.

c. Build PX4
```
cd  ~/PX4-Autopilot
DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl gazebo
```

d. Export Environment variables

```
echo 'source ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/setup_gazebo.bash ~/PX4-Autopilot ~/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
e. Try launching PX4 simulation (optional)

```
roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch
pxh> commander arm # when launching finishes
```

3. Launch drone inside behaviour metrics
```
cd  < path to BehaviorMetrics >
python3 driver_gazebo.py -c ./configs/gazebo/default-drone.yml -g
```

## Installation using Docker <a name="docker-installation"></a>

The docker installation guide is very clear and can be found in this [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) which is well documented.

### Download Docker in Ubuntu

First remove older versions.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

Then setup the stable repository

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"    
```

Install the docker engine

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Add your user to the docker's group to avoid using `sudo` for docker, you have to log out and log in and restart to for this change to take effect. 

```
sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
```

Test your installation

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## Running Behavior Metrics Containers <a name="starting-docker"></a>

Open up a terminal a paste the following command. Creating a volume is recommended so you can add models or datasets easily.
To create the volume update `local_directory` to yur local directory where your datasets and models are located and `docker_directory` to the
directory you want them to be stored inside the container.

### For CPU only

```bash
docker run -dit --name behavior-metrics-noetic \
	-p 5900:5900 \
	-p 8888:8888 \
        -v [local_directory]:[docker_directory] \
	jderobot/behavior-metrics:noetic
```

### For GPU support (CUDA 10.1 Cudnn 7)

Some extra packages are needed for Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04, more about installation in [nvidia-docker docs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).

```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

The flag `--gpus` is added along with the correct image that contains cuda drivers.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -dit --name behavior-metrics-noetic \
        -p 5900:5900 \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        jderobot/behavior-metrics:noetic-10.1-cudnn7
```
For GPU support on WSL refer [Getting started with CUDA on Ubuntu on WSL 2](https://ubuntu.com/blog/getting-started-with-cuda-on-ubuntu-on-wsl-2).

### Using VNC to visualize container <a name="vnc"></a>

To connect to our container [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/) can be installed to access the GUI through the port 5900.

{% include gallery id="gallery4" %}

Once vnc-viewer is open fill in `localhost:5900` in the address and then press connect.

{% include gallery id="gallery5" %}

You will need to authenticate, the current password is **jderobot**, although it can be changed in the script `vnc_startup.sh`.

### Using terminal in container <a name="term"></a>

The recommended way to work, is by writing down `docker logs container-name` and you will get an URL, which will take you to notebook, double click on the last URL to open Jupyter.

```bash
docker logs behavior-metrics-noetic
```

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

Go to that URL in the browser (outside VNC) and once you are in the notebook you can open up a terminal by clicking in Terminal.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

A terminal window will open. Type 

```bash
bash
``` 

and this window will behave as any other Ubuntu terminal, so you are ready to run Behavior Metrics, once the GUI is opened it will be displayed in the VNC window.

```bash
cd BehaviorMetrics/behavior_metrics/
python3 driver_gazebo.py -c configs/gazebo/default.yml -g
```

This command will open the Gazebo Simulation in the VNC window. You can also directly run the previous command inside VNC window in a terminal.

**IF THE PREVIOUS COMMAND FAILS** try the following and try again:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

{% include gallery id="gallery1" %}

### Stopping container <a name="stop"></a>

`behavior-metrics-noetic` should be replaced with the name of your container.

```bash
docker stop behavior-metrics-noetic
```

### Resuming container <a name="resume"></a>

`behavior-metrics-noetic` should be replace with the name of your container, this command is similar to `docker run` so now you can run `docker logs container_name` to get a new link for jupyter, and then connect as usual to your VNC viewer.

```bash
docker restart behavior-metrics-noetic
```

## Building the latest container <a name="building"></a>

First go to the folder where the `Dockerfile` is, then use docker use docker built command with the desired name tag.

```bash
cd BehaviorMetrics/.docker/noetic/
docker build -t any-tag-you-want .
```

From here you are to good to go to the [Quick Start guide!](../carla/)
