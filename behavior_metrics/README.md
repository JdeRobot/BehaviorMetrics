The objective of this project is to **take images** from the camera on a circuit where the mission is to follow a red line to complete a lap of the circuit **using classification and regression neural networks**.

## Info

- More detailed info at my [Github-pages](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2017-tfm-vanessa-fernandez/).


## Datasets

There are currently **two sets** of data to train the neural network that resolves the circuit. One contains **images of all types** such as straights and curves and the other contains **only the curves** of the circuit. The second one is smaller and the results are good enough to solve a lap of the circuit.

## Installation

- First of all, we need to **install the JdeRobot environment** packages. We need two packages: [JdeRobot-base](https://github.com/JdeRobot/base) and [JdeRobot-assets](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets). You can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/JdeRobot/base#getting-environment-ready) for the complete installation.

- Install ROS plugins typing:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-melodic-gazebo-plugins
    ```

- Clone the repository :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2017-tfm-vanessa-fernandez.git
    ```

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python2.7 --system-site-packages neural_behavior_env
    ```

- Install `requirements`:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Launch Gazebo with the F1 world through the command:

    ```bash
    roslaunch /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/launch/f1_1_simplecircuit.launch
    ```

- Then you have to execute the application, which will incorporate your code:

    ```bash
    python2 driver.py driver.yml
    ```


## Usage

### 1. Manual Solution

For this solution, the **code developed in the robotics course of the Official Master's Degree** in **Computer Vision** has been used. The structure of the project allows to combine between the different solutions. As a first approach, the one developed manually by a student or user is used.

An excerpt of the solution can be seen in the following gif:

<img src="../docs/assets/images/piloto_esplicito.gif" alt="piloto_esplicito" style="zoom:40%;" />



### 2. Classification Network

The solution using **classification networks** leaves a somewhat slower solution than the manual solution but equally useful. A piece of the solution can be seen in the following gif.

<img src="./docs/assets/images/piloto_neuronal.gif" alt="piloto_neuronal" style="zoom:40%;" />

Depending on the type of network you want to run (normal or cropped) you have to change the size of the images entering the network in the `ckassification_network.py` file.

For **cropped images**, the values are:

```python
. . .
self.img_height = 60
self.img_width = 160
. . . 
```

You also need to change the predict method to configure it to the image type:

```python
def predict(self):
    input_image = self.camera.getImage()
    # Preprocessing
    img = cv2.cvtColor(input_image.data[240:480, 0:640], cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    . . .
```

For **normal images**, the default value is:

```python
. . . 
self.img_height = 120
. . .
```

The `predict` method is the same but without cropping the image:

```python
def predict(self):
    input_image = self.camera.getImage()
    # Preprocessing
    img = cv2.cvtColor(input_image.data, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    . . .
```

In the same file you can specify the number of output classes, which refers to the number of possible rotation angles.

```python
self.num_classes_w = 7
```

#### Train Classification Network

To train the classification network to run the file:

```bash
cd 2017-tfm-vanessa-fernandez/Follow Line/dl-driver/Net/Keras/ 
python classification_train.py
```

When the program is running it will ask for data to know the characteristics of the network to be trained:

1. **Choose one of the options for the number of classes:** *Choose the number of classes you want, typically 4-5 for `v` parameter and 2, 7 or 9 for `w` parameter. Depending on the dataset created, there are different classifications in the json depending on the number of classes for each screen.*

2. **Choose the variable you want to train:** `v` or `w`: *here you put `v` or `w` depending on the type of speed you want to train (traction or turn).*

3. **Choose the type of image you want:** `normal` or `cropped`: *you can choose `normal` or `cropped`. If you want to train with the full image you have to choose `normal` and if you want to train with the cropped image choose `cropped`.*

4. **Choose the type of network you want: normal, biased or balanced:** *this option refers to the type of dataset or training you want.* 

   *The documentation talks about having on the one hand a training with the whole dataset without any type of treatment of the number of images for each class (there were many more straight lines than curves) or using a balanced dataset that we created keeping the same number of images for each class (v and w),* 

   *To train with that configuration, set the `normal` option. To train with balanced dataset, set the option: `balanced`.*

   *And finally, `biased` refers to you training with the full dataset (unbalanced) but in training you put weights to each class with `class_weigth` type.*

   ```python
   class_weight = {0: 4., 1: 2., 2: 2., 3: 1., 4:2., 5: 2., 6: 3.}
   ```

   *then with this option you can give more weight to the kinds of curves than straight lines. In that example the class 0 is the class `radically_left` and the 6 would be `radically_right`. The option that worked best was that of 'biased'.*

5. **Choose the model you want to use:** `lenet`, `smaller_vgg` or `other`: *Here you have to choose the model you want to train. The option that offers the best results is `smaller_vgg`. The `lenet` model gave very bad results because it was very basic. The `other` model loaded another model that gives worse results. The files containing the network models as such are in the folder `models/`. For classification you have them in `classification_model.py` for regression in `model_nvidia.py`.*

### 3. Regression Network

If you want to train the regression network you have to run the `regression_train.py` file which is in the `/net/keras/` path. To run it, type `python train.py`. When you run it, it will ask you for the parameters for the training.

1. **Choose the type of image you want:** `normal` or `cropped`: *you can choose `normal` or `cropped`. If you want to train with the full image you have to choose `normal` and if you want to train with the cropped image choose `cropped`.*

2. **Choose the type of network you want**: The available options are:

   - `pilotnet`.
   - `tinypilotnet`.
   - `lstm_tinypilotnet`. 
   - `lstm`
   - `deepestlstm_tinypilotnet`.
   - `controlnet`
   - `stacked`
   - `stacked_dif` or `temporal`.
